# Install and run server locally

Note for macOS users: install Homebrew first.
Note for Windows users: install Chocolatey first. Sometimes Dart Sass will show error when install, don't panic, just searching around Stackoverflow ðŸ¥².

1. Install golang at https://go.dev/doc/install
2. Install Dart Sass (follow instructions here for each OS: https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/transpile-sass-to-css/#dart-sass)
3. Install hugo (choose your installation method based on your OS here: https://gohugo.io/installation/)
4. Pull this repo
5. Run hugo server -D

# Write post

1. Checkout another branch before do anything because master branch is locked
2. All post goes under folder `content/posts` with markdown format. You can wrap all your related posts under sub folder like this `content/posts/java-series`.
3. If your name is not listed inside list authors in `hugo.yaml` under `params.authors` section, feel free to add your name or nickname or whatever you want to show as author. Only when you added your name into this list authors, you can add your name into posts metadata.
3. Do not put video file inside this repo. If you want to embed a video, upload to YouTube first, then embed the link only.
4. Images are allowed but try to minimize the size (you can use free only tools for resize/crop). Each post has only 5MB of size only including text, assets like images. For even better, you can upload images to sources like Imgur, Google Photos, etc. and get image link and put into your post. If you use the images directly from codebase, put it under the same folder of your posts and ref it with `![An image here](./image.png)`.
5. Do not change anything inside `themes/PaperMod` and `layouts/partials` folder. It can break the UI and I don't know how to fix.
6. Make sure your post is ready (run and view as expected on local first) before create pull request to master. Everything goes into master will be deployed automatically and visible on UI.
7. You can refer to PaperMod documentation for more details about the markdown format they use for rich content, math typeset, emoji.
8. When create a post, you can follow the metadata format inside `template/template.md`.
